# NGINX Wrapper API

## üöÄ Overview
#### This is a lightweight and secure REST API that allows you to manage and monitor your [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) service safely and programmatically.  
#### It integrates cleanly into Linux environments that use `systemd` and includes [**Let's Encrypt**](https://letsencrypt.org) integration for automated SSL management.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Production Recommendation:** Always use HTTPS ‚Äî preferably behind a reverse proxy such as [**NGINX**](https://nginx.org/) or [**Caddy**](https://caddyserver.com/).

## üß± Features

- ‚úÖ Start, stop, reload, and restart NGINX via REST endpoints 
- ‚öôÔ∏è Systemd integration for reliable process control  
- üåç SSL automation with [**Certbot**](https://certbot.eff.org/) / [**Let's Encrypt**](https://letsencrypt.org)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisities


Before you begin, make sure your environment includes:

- A **Linux** system with `systemd`  
- **NGINX** installed and managed by `systemctl`  
- **Certbot** (for SSL certificate automation)  
- **Rust toolchain** (via [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs))

## üèóÔ∏è Build & Run

### Production build

```bash
cargo build --release

## üß© Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

| Variable | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `API_KEY` | Secret API key used for authentication |
| `HOST` | Host address for the API server |
| `PORT` | Port to run the API server on |
| `WORKERS` | Number of worker threads to spawn |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Never expose your real `API_KEY` in a public environment.

Example `.env` file:

```env
API_KEY=supersecretkey123
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=8080
WORKERS=4
```
